## Abstract

The main objective of this work is the modeling of a management system to optimize the power flows between the different generators, storage systems and loads of a commercial aircraft MEA to achieve greater autonomy, reliability and robustness.

To this end, an adaptation of a previous work described in the paper [Wang, X.; Atkin, J.; Bazmohammadi, N.; Bozhko, S.; Guerrero, J.M. Optimal Load and Energy Management of Aircraft Microgrids Using Multi-Objective Model Predictive Control. Sustainability 2021, 13, 13907.](https://doi.org/10.3390/su132413907), in which a centralized system-level management strategy based on model predictive control (MPC) is proposed for an MEA to be able to schedule battery systems and exploit flexibility in load demand while satisfying time-varying operational requirements.

The proposed control strategy aims to maintain energy storage and prolong the battery life cycle, while minimizing load disconnections, trying to avoid constant state changes to increase the lifetime of the devices. Using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, different objective functions are proposed to realize the control objectives, with soft constraints that improve the feasibility of the model.

In addition, to lay the groundwork and understand what these new generations of More Electric Aircraft and electric power systems consist of, the concept will be explained and a general review of the technological advances used to achieve various objectives such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reducing fossil fuel consumption will be provided
